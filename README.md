# padding_EBI
Analysis of the effect of sequence padding on the performance of protein functional annotation tasks.

## Material
Experiments will be performed in reviewed proteins of taxonomy Archaea (~20k) and Bacteria (~300k).

## Methods
Different types of padding will be tested in the context of a Deep Learning model for hierarchical EC number prediction.

## System
*tob*: 32GB RAM, 2 GPUs; *lapsus*: 32GB RAM, 2 GPUs.
